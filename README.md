# Analysing-Songs
This is a coding project where I write a program which analysis lyrics of the songs of different artists.

This program is 28 lines, hence it is shorter than Phineases's prgoram which has 29. congrats to me

The video also could not capture my graph for some reason so I added it in files as ana image.
